**DO NOT POST QUESTIONS/BUG-REPORTS/REQUESTS IN THE REVIEWS**

It is difficult to carry a conversation in the reviews.  If you
have a question/bug-report/request please use the
[Thread](http://forums.pocketmine.net/threads/zippluginloader.8924) for
that.  You are more likely to get a response and help that way.

_NOTE:_ This documentation was last updated for version **1.2.1**.

Please go to
[github](https://github.com/Muirfield/ZipPluginLoader)
for the most up-to-date documentation.

You can also download this plugin from this [page](https://github.com/Muirfield/ZipPluginLoader/releases).

When clonning this repository make sure you use the `--recursive` option:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Muirfield/ZipPluginLoader.git
    
Otherwise you need to initialize sub-modules manually:

    git clone https://github.com/Muirfield/ZipPluginLoader.git
    cd ZipPluginLoader
    git submodule update --init --recursive

**NOTE: This is unlike _DevTools_, as it is focus on only loading Zip files
instead of folders like _DevTools_.**  You still need _DevTools_ if
you actually want to do Plugin Development and to create _phar_ file
plugins.

This plugin let's you load plugins from zip files.  This is
particularly handy when trying out source plugins from
[GitHub](http://github.com) as you can click the **Download ZIP**
button, as you can then place the zip file in the plugins folder.

Essentially you put your plugin code in a zip file, and this plugin
will look for a **plugin.yml** file in there and load the plugin.

If there are multiple plugins in a zip file, all the plugins will be
loaded by default.  You can control what plugins will be loaded by
creating a control file.  For example if you have a:

	example.zip

You need to create a text file called:

	example.ctl

In this file you list (one plugin per line) the plugins that you want
to load.  Any plugins **not** in listed the control file will **not** be
loaded.
